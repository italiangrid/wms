<<<OPT>>>--noint

if this option is specified, every interactive question to the user is skipped and the operation is continued 
(when possible)
<<<ENDOPT>>>


<<<OPT>>>--input, -i <filepath>

Allow the user to select the desired job among the ones contained in the file located in <filepath>. 
This option cannot be used if the jobId has been specified. A job has to be selected specifying 
the numbers associated to the job identifier
<<<ENDOPT>>>


<<<OPT>>>--delegationid, -d <idstring>

if this option is specified, the user proxy associated to the id delegated previously will be displayed.
<<<ENDOPT>>>


<<<OPT>>>--proxy, -p <JobID>

Retrieves and displays information for the proxy delegated with the specified JobId: 
the WMProxy service where the job was submitted is contacted and asked for needed information.
<<<ENDOPT>>>


<<<OPT>>>---jdl <jobid>

Retrieves and displays the JDL registered to the LB service for the specified JobId: 
the WMProxy service where the job was submitted is contacted and asked for needed information.
This option is only available from glite version >= 3.1.
<<<ENDOPT>>>


<<<OPT>>>--jdl-original, -j <jobid>

Retrieves and displays the original JDL submitted by the user to the WMProxy service. 
This information might be quite different from the registered JDL, mostly for parametric and collection of jobs.
This option is only available from glite version >= 3.1.
<<<ENDOPT>>>


<<<OPT>>>--endpoint, -e <serviceURL>

when this option is specified, the operations are performed contacting the WMProxy 
service represented by the given <serviceURL>. If it is not used, the endpoint contacted is that one 
specified by the GLITE<<<USC>>>WMS<<<USC>>>WMPROXY<<<USC>>>ENDPOINT environment variable. 
If both this option is not specified 
and the environment variable is not set, the service request will be sent to one of the endpoints listed 
in the WMProxyEndPoints attribute in the user configuration file (randomly chosen among the URLs of the 
attribute list). If the chosen service is not available, a succession of attempts are performed on the 
other specified services until the connection with one of these endpoints can be established or all 
services have been contacted without success. In this latter case the operation can not be obviously 
performed and the execution of the command is stopped with an error message.
<<<ENDOPT>>>


<<<OPT>>>--output, -o <filename>

Stores the retrieved information into the specified file instead of the standard output. 
The specified file path can be either a simple name or an absolute path (on the submitting machine). 
In the former case the file <filepath> is created in the current working directory.
This option is only available from glite version >= 3.1.
