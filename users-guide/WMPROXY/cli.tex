%\section{Commandline Interfaces}

In this section we describe syntax and behavior of the commands made available by the WMProxy client
to allow jobs, DAGs and Collections submission. Jobs in turn can be batch, interactive, MPI-based, checkpointable,
partitionable and parametric.
Besides requests submission, the WMProxy client also exposes additional
functionality for request management and control such as cancellation, job files perusal and
output retrieval. Requests status follow-up can be instead achieved through
the functionality exposed by the Logging \& Bookkeeping (LB) service described in
~\cite{LB}.
