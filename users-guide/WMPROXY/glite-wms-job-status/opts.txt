<<<OPT>>>--input, -i <filepath>

Allow the user to select the JobId(s) from an input file located in <filepath>.
The list of jobIds contained in the file is displayed and the user is prompted for a choice. Single 
jobs can be selected specifying the numbers associated to the job identifiers separated by commas. 
E.g. selects the first, the third and the fifth jobId in the list.
Ranges can also be selected specifying ends separated by a dash. E.g. selects jobIds in the list 
from third position (included) to sixth position (included). It is worth mentioning that it is 
possible to select at the same time ranges and single jobs. E.g. selects the first job id in the list, 
the ids from the third to the fifth (ends included) and finally the eighth one.
When specified toghether with --noint, all available JobId are selected.
 This option cannot be used when one or more jobIds have been specified as extra command argument
