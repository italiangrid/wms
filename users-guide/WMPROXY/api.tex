%\subsection{WMProxy Client API Description}

The WMProxy client API supplies the client applications with a set of 
interfaces over the job submission and control services made available 
by the gLite WMS through a web service based interface. 
The API provides the corresponding method for each operation published in the
WSDL description of the WMProxy Service ~\cite{wmproxy-wsdl}. 

The request types supported by the WMProxy Service are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Job: a simple application
  \item DAG: a direct acyclic graph of dependent jobs
  \item Collection: a set of independent jobs
\end{itemize}

Jobs in turn can be batch, interactive, MPI-based, checkpointable,
partitionable and parametric. The specification of the JDL for describing the 
mentioned request types is available at ~\cite{JDL}.
Besides requests submission, the WMProxy also exposes additional
functionality for request management and control such as cancellation, job files perusal and
output retrieval. Requests status follow-up can be instead achieved through
the functionality exposed by the Logging \& Bookkeeping (LB) service ~\cite{LB}.

The documentation describing the WMProxy Client API providing C++, Java and Python bindings 
can be found at \url{http://egee-jra1-wm.mi.infn.it/egee-jra1-wm/glite-wmproxy-api-index.shtml}.
Pointers to usage examples are provided in the above mentioned web page.
