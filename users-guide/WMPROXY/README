This File will learn you how to generate the Wmproxy guide PDF document


1) Set the ENV variable:    TEXINPUTS=:..:autogen// to run TeX on this document.
Files in autogen// come from Doxygen and similar tools. They should not be edited by hand.

2) Issue the following commands:
   - ./createdoc.sh (from bash)
   - pdflatex WMPROXY-guide

If prompted to question such as:
	l.160 \geometry{centering,includeheadfoot}
	?
then just hit return. In order to resolve symbolic internal links, the same command might be issued more than once
