<<<OPT>>>--noint

if this option is specified, every interactive question to the user is skipped and the operation is continued (when possible)
<<<ENDOPT>>>


<<<OPT>>>--input, -i <filepath>

this option makes the command return the OutputSandbox files for each jobId contained in the <filepath>. 
This option can't be used if one (or more) jobIds have been already specified. 
The format of the input file must be as follows: one jobId for each line and comment lines must begin with a 
'#' or a '*' character. When this option is used, the list of jobIds contained in the file is displayed and 
the user is prompted for a choice. Single jobs can be selected specifying the numbers associated to the job 
identifiers separated by commas.
E.g. selects the first,the third and the fifth jobId in the list. Ranges can also be selected specifying 
ends separated by a dash. E.g. "3-6" selects jobIds in the list from third position (included) to sixth position 
(included). It is worth mentioning that it is possible to select at the same time ranges and single jobs.
E.g. selects the first job id in the list, the ids from the third to the fifth (ends included) and finally 
the eighth one.
<<<ENDOPT>>>


<<<OPT>>>--dir <directory<<<USC>>>path>

if this option is specified, the retrieved files (previously listed by the user through the OutputSandbox 
attribute of the job description file) are stored in a directory whose name is 
<<<INLINEVERB>>>username_<JOB_Identifier><<<ENDINLINEVERB>>>; this directory, in turn, is located in the 
location indicated by directory<<<USC>>>path. If --dir is not specified, the directory containing the job's output 
files will be put in the destination folder specified as value of the JDL attribute OutputStorage 
(see section <<<REF>>>confattr<<<ENDREF>>> at page <<<PAGEREF>>>confattr<<<ENDPAGEREF>>>).
<<<ENDOPT>>>


<<<OPT>>>--nosubdir 

job's output files are located in the destination folder (specified with --dir option or through the 
OutputStorage JDL parameter) without creating any subdirectory.
<<<ENDOPT>>>



<<<OPT>>>--nopurge

if this option is specified, the output sandbox on WMS node is not purged, and the command can be repeated 
(the job's output can be retrieved again).
<<<ENDOPT>>>


<<<OPT>>>--proto <protocol>

this option specifies the protocol to be used for file transferring. It will be ignored when the specified 
protocol is not found among WMProxy service available protocols: in this case the default one (generally gsiftp ) 
will be used instead.
This option is only available from glite version >= 3.1.
<<<ENDOPT>>>


<<<OPT>>>--list-only

when this option is specified, the output files (previously listed by the user through the OutputSandbox 
attribute of the job description file) are not retrieved. The command only displays the list of URIs indicating
 where they are currently located.
<<<ENDOPT>>>


<<<OPT>>>--json

This option makes the command produce its output in JSON-compliant format, that can be parsed by proper json 
libraries for python/perl and other script languages.
<<<ENDOPT>>>


<<<OPT>>>--pretty-print

This option should be used with --json. Without it the JSON format is machine-oriented 
(no carriage returns, no indentations). 
--pretty-print makes the JSON output easily readable by a human. Using this option without --json has no effect.
