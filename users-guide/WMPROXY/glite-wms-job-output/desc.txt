glite-wms-job-output retrieves the output files of a job that has been submitted through the glite-wms-job-submit 
command with a job description file including the OutputSandbox attribute.
After the submission, when the job has terminated its execution, the user can download the files generated 
by the job and temporarily stored on the WMS machine as specified by the OutputSandbox attribute, 
issuing the glite-wms-job-output with as input the jobId returned by the glite-wms-job-submit.
