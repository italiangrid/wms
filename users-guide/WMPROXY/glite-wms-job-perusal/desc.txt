Allows handling files perusal functionality for a submitted job identified by the jobId.
This can be done only when files perusal support has been enabled while submitting/registering the job.
This is accomplished via the 'PerusalFileEnable' JDL attribute.

Three different operations can be performed for a given job:

<<<ITEMIZE>>>
<<<ITEM>>> Job's file perusal set (--set option): it allows enabling the perusal functionality 
for one or more specified files.

This option requires the user to specify the file(s) to be perused: this can be done by using either the 
--filename (multiple files 
can be specified by repeating the option several times) or the --input option (the user will be prompted 
to select one or more files).

<<<ITEM>>> Job's file perusal get (--get option): it allows retrieving chunks of one
specified job's file previously set for perusal by means of the --set option.

This option requires the user to specify the file to be retrieved: this can be done by using either the --filename 
(no multiple files support available) or the --input option (the user will be prompted to select one file). 
The specified file is therefore downloaded on the local machine and it can be viewed on the user shell. 
User can specify a custom directory where to download the files by using the --dir option. 
The retrieval of files to be perused 
is available as soon as the job has started running: the command will retrieve the content of the 
generated file up to 
the time of the call. By default, any further call on the same file, retrieves back only the last chunks of the file, 
that means only the information stored after the last call. 
To retrieve all chunks of a given file (even those that might have been previously retrieved), 
the --all option must be specified.

<<<ITEM>>> Job's file perusal unset (--unset option): it disables perusal for all job's files 
(no further option required)
<<<ENDITEMIZE>>>

All Perusal functionality are available for simple jobs and for nodes of compound jobs 
(like DAGs, collections and parametric jobs) 
but not for compound jobs as a whole. Moreover the WMProxy service version must be greater than or 
equal to 2.0.0 
(the service version can be retrieved by using the --version option of the client commands).
