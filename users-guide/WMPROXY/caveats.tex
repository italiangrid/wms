%\section{Known Problems and Caveats}
%\label{caveats}

\begin{itemize}

\item
Since the gridftp protocol (the protocol used for the InputSanbox files 
staging) 
in general doesn't preserve the x flag, the script specified as 
\emph{Executable} in the JDL, should perform a \emph{chmod +x} for all the files 
needing execution permission, that are transferred within the InputSandbox 
of the job.


\item
The \emph{Arguments} 
attribute in the JDL allows the user to specify all the command 
line arguments needed to start the job
They have to be specified as a single string, e.g. the job sum that is started 
with:

\smallskip
{\scriptsize{\verb!$ sum  N1 N2 -out result.out!}}
\smallskip

is described by: 

\smallskip
\begin{verbatim}
Executable = ``sum'';
Arguments = ``N1 N2 -out result.out'';
\end{verbatim}
\smallskip

\item
There's a known issue related with \verb /tmp  directory fill up:  the \verb /tmp  partition fills up with files generated by job submission. For a large volume of job submission this can be a problem. Typically several thousands of the following files into the \verb /tmp  dir can be found:

\begin{verbatim}
ISBfiles_PMV62G23KkHp4WwHFJIZwA_0.tar.gz
\end{verbatim}

These files correspond to the data tar archives being send in the input sandbox to the WMS.

Some search in the glite dir indicated that the \verb bin/glite-wms-job-submit  matches the ISBfiles string.


\item
If you want to specify a quoted string inside the Arguments then you have to escape quotes with the $\backslash$
character. e.g. when describing a job like:

\smallskip
{\scriptsize{\verb!$ grep -i ``my name'' *.txt!}}
\smallskip
you will have to specify:

\smallskip
\begin{verbatim}
Executable = ``/bin/grep'';
Arguments = ``-i \``my name\'' *.txt'';
\end{verbatim}
\smallskip



\end{itemize}
