%\subsection{Introduction}

The WMProxy (Workload Manager Proxy) is a simple service providing access 
to the WMS (Workload Management System) functionality through a Web Services based 
interface the user can interact with by mean of the WMS Command Line Interface (WMS CLI or WMS UI).

WMProxy accepts job submission requests described with the job description language 
(JDL) whose specification is available at~\cite{JDL} and other job management and 
control requests such as job cancellation, job file perusal, job output retrieval etc.

This service replaces with a Web Services based interface the legacy interface to the WMS 
represented by the Network Server described in \cite{WMS} and provides additional 
functionality such as bulk submission and support for shared and compressed sandboxes. 

The WMProxy can be either accessed directly through the published WSDL available 
at~\cite{wmproxy-wsdl} or through the provided client tools that are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item a C++ command line interface (Sect. \ref{cli}).
  \item an API providing C++, Java and Python bindings (Sect. \ref{api}). 
\end{itemize}

Further information about the WMProxy Service can be found at \cite{wmproxy-wiki}.
