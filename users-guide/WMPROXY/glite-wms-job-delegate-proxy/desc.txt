glite-wms-job-delegate-proxy allows delegating a user proxy to the WMProxy service. 
The user can either specify the delegationid to be associated with the delegated proxy by
using the --delegationid option:
<<<VERB>>>
glite-wms-job-delegate-proxy -d mydelegationiD
<<<ENDVERB>>>
or make the command automatically generate an ID by using the --autm-delegation option.
<<<NEWLINE>>>
One of these two options is mandatory and they're mutually exclusive.
If a delegation with the same id and belonging to the same user already exists in the WMProxy service, 
the new proxy will overwrite the one associated to that delegation id.
Credential delegation with the same id used for a proxy belonging to another user is possible.
