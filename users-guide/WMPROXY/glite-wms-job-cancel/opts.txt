<<<OPT>>>--noint  

if this option is specified, every interactive question to the user is skipped and the 
operation is continued (when possible)
<<<ENDOPT>>>

<<<OPT>>>--input, -i <filepath>

cancels jobs whose jobIds are contained in the file located in filepath. 
This option cannot be used if one or more jobIds have been specified. 
If the --noint is not specified, the list of jobIds contained in the file is displayed and the 
user is prompted for a choice. Single jobs can be selected specifying the numbers associated to 
the job identifiers separated by commas. E.g. selects the first, the third and the fifth jobId in 
the list.
Ranges can also be selected specifying ends separated by a dash. E.g. selects jobIds in the 
list from third position (included) to sixth position (included).
It is worth mentioning that it is possible to select at the same time ranges and single jobs. 
E.g. selects the first job id in the list, the ids from the third to the fifth (ends included) 
and finally the eighth one.
<<<ENDOPT>>>

<<<OPT>>>--output, -o <filepath>

writes the cancellation results in the file specified by <filepath> instead of the standard output. 
<filepath> can be either a simple name or an absolute path (on the submitting machine). 
In the former case the file <filepath> is created in the current working directory.
<<<ENDOPT>>>


<<<OPT>>>--json

This option makes the command produce its output in JSON-compliant format, that can be 
parsed by proper json libraries for python/perl and other script languages. 
Please note that --json and --output options are mutually exclusive.
<<<ENDOPT>>>


<<<OPT>>>--pretty-print

This option should be used with --json. Without it the JSON format is machine-oriented 
(no carriage returns, no indentations). --pretty-print makes the JSON output easily readable 
by a human. Using this option without --json has no effect.
