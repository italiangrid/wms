glite-wms-job-cancel cancels a job previously submitted using glite-wms-job-submit. 
Before cancellation, it prompts the user for confirmation. 
The cancel request is sent to the WMProxy that forwards it to the WM that fulfills it. 
glite-wms-job-cancel can remove one or more jobs: the jobs to be removed are 
identified by their job identifiers (jobIds returned by glite-wms-job-submit) 
provided as arguments to the command and separated by a blank space. 
The result of the cancel operation is reported to the user for each specified jobId.
