<<<OPT>>>--noint

if this option is specified, every interactive question to the user is skipped 
(yes is assumed as answer) and the operation is continued (when possible)
<<<ENDOPT>>>


<<<OPT>>>--delegationid, -d <idstring>

if this option is specified, the proxy that will be delegated is identified by 
<idstring>. This proxy can be therefore used for operations like job registration, 
job submission and job list matching until its expiration specifying the <idstring>. 
It must be used in place of --autm-delegation option.
<<<ENDOPT>>>


<<<OPT>>>--autm-delegation, -a

this option is specified to make automatic generation of the identifier string 
(delegationid) that will be associated to the delegated proxy. It must be used 
in place of the --delegationid (-d) option.
<<<ENDOPT>>>


<<<OPT>>>--endpoint, -e <serviceURL>

when this option is specified, the operations are performed contacting the WMProxy 
service represented by the given <serviceURL>. If it is not used, the endpoint 
contacted is that one specified by the GLITE\_WMS\_WMPROXY\_ENDPOINT environment variable. 
If none of these options is specified and the environment variable is not set, 
the service request will be sent to one of the endpoints listed in the WMProxyEndPoints 
attribute in the user configuration file (randomly chosen among the URLs of the attribute list). 
If the chosen service is not available, a succession of attempts are performed 
on the other specified services until the connection with one of these endpoints 
can be established or all services have been contacted without success. In this latter 
case the operation can not be obviously performed and the execution of the command is 
stopped with an error message.
<<<ENDOPT>>>


<<<OPT>>>--rank

displays the "matching" CEIds and the associated ranking values.
<<<ENDOPT>>>


<<<OPT>>>output, -o <filepath>

returns the CEIds list in the file specified by filepath. <filepath> can be either a 
simple name or an absolute path (on the submitting machine). 
In the former case the file <filepath> is created in the current working directory.
<<<ENDOPT>>>


<<<OPT>>>--json

This option makes the command produce its output in JSON-compliant format, 
that can be parsed by proper json libraries for python/perl and other script 
languages. Please note that --json and --output options are mutually exclusive.
<<<ENDOPT>>>


<<<OPT>>>--pretty-print

This option should be used with --json. Without it the JSON format is 
machine-oriented (no carriage returns, no indentations). --pretty-print makes 
the JSON output easily readable by a human. Using this option without --json has no effect.
<<<ENDOPT>>>
