%\subsection{Interactions with other Services}

All WMS components described in section~\ref{arch} interact with the LB for logging information about the 
jobs they are handling and for querying information about them when needed.
Moreover during the matchmaking phase the Resource Broker interacts with the Data Management Catalogs through 
the StorageIndex interface to resolve the locations of existing file names specified in the JDL Inputdata list, 
so that the submitted job would run on worker node, close to the used files.

The WMS service also interacts with VOMS indirectly as it reads information about VO, groups and capabilities 
(Fully Qualified Attribute Names ~\cite{voms-core}) from the user's proxy credentials issued by VOMS to enforce 
user authentication and authorization.
The MyProxy service is contacted by the Proxy Renewal component of the WMS to renew automatically the 
credentials associated to long lived jobs.

Last but not least the WMS interacts with the CEs for submitting jobs (this goes through CondorC) and for receiving 
synchronous/asynchronous notifications about resource status and characteristics.
There could be configurations in which the WMS also interacts with the BDII to collect information about the whole 
resource pool available for a given VO.
