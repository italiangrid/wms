	--noint

\textbf{DESCRIPTION}
\smallskip


This command cancels a job previously submitted using glite-job-submit. Before cancellation, it prompts the user for confirmation.
The cancel request is sent to the Network Server that forwards it to the WM that fulfils it.
glite-job-cancel can remove one or more jobs: the jobs to be removed are identified by their job identifiers (jobIds returned by glite-job-submit) provided as arguments to the command and separated by a blank space.
The result of the cancel operation is reported to the user for each specified jobId.

\medskip
\textbf{OPTIONS}
\smallskip

\textbf{--version}

displays UI version.

\textbf{--help}

displays command usage

\textbf{--config}, \textbf{-c} <configfile>

if the command is launched with this option, the configuration file pointed by configfile is used. This option is meaningless when used together with "--vo" option

\textbf{--debug}

When this option is specified, debugging information is displayed on the standard output and written into the log file, whose location is eventually printed on screen.
The default UI logfile location is:
glite-wms-job-<command\_name>\_<uid>\_<pid>\_<time>.log  located under the /var/tmp directory
please notice that this path can be overriden with the '--logfile' option

\textbf{--logfile} <filepath>

when this option is specified, all information is written into the specified file pointed by filepath.
This option will override the default location of the logfile:
glite-wms-job-<command\_name>\_<uid>\_<pid>\_<time>.log  located under the /var/tmp directory

\textbf{--noint}

if this option is specified, every interactive question to the user is skipped and the operation is continued (when possible)

\textbf{--input}, \textbf{-i} <filepath>

Allow the user to select the JobId(s) from an input file located in filepath.
The list of jobIds contained in the file is displayed and the user is prompted for a choice. Single jobs can be selected specifying the numbers associated to the job identifiers separated by commas. E.g. selects the first,the third and the fifth jobId in the list.
Ranges can also be selected specifying ends separated by a dash. E.g. selects jobIds in the list from third position (included) to sixth position (included). It is worth mentioning that it is possible to select at the same time ranges and single jobs. E.g. selects the first job id in the list, the ids from the third to the fifth (ends included) and finally the eighth one.
When specified toghether with '--noint', all available JobId are selected.
This option cannot be used when one or more jobIds have been specified as extra command argument

\textbf{--output}, \textbf{-o} <filepath>

writes the results of the operation in the file specified by filepath instead of the standard output. filepath can be either a simple name or an absolute path (on the submitting machine). In the former case the file filepath is created in the current working directory.

\textbf{--all}

displays status information about all job owned by the user submitting the command. This option can't be used
either if one or more jobIds have been specified or if the --input option has been specified. All LBs
listed in the vo-specific UI configuration file \$GLITE\_WMS\_LOCATION/etc/<vo\_name>/glite\_wmsui.conf are contacted to
fulfil this request.

\textbf{--config-vo} <configfile>

if the command is launched with this option, the VO-specific configuration file pointed by configfile is used. This option is meaningless when used together with "--vo" option

\textbf{--vo} <voname>

this option allows the user to specify the name of the Virtual Organisation she/he is currently working for.
If the user proxy contains VOMS extensions then the VO specified through this option is overridden by the default VO contained in the proxy (i.e. this option is only useful when working with non-VOMS proxies).
This option is meaningless when used together with "--config-vo" option


\medskip
\textbf{EXAMPLES}
\smallskip


1) request for canceling only one job:
glite-job-cancel https://wmproxy.glite.it:9000/7O0j4Fequpg7M6SRJ-NvLg

2)	request for canceling multiple jobs:
glite-job-cancel https://wmproxy.glite.it:9000/7O0j4Fequpg7M6SRJ-NvLg https://wmproxy.glite.it:9000/wqikja\_-de83jdqd https://wmproxy.glite.it:9000/jdh\_wpwkd134ywhq6p

3)	the myids.in input file contains the jobid(s) to be cancelled (the user will be prompted for selection and confirmation)
glite-job-output --input myids.in

A message with the result of the operation is displayed on the standard output

\medskip
\textbf{ENVIRONMENT}
\smallskip


GLITE\_WMSUI\_CONFIG\_VAR:  This variable may be set to specify the path location of the custom default attribute configuration

GLITE\_WMSUI\_CONFIG\_VO: This variable may be set to specify the path location of the VO-specific configuration file

GLITE\_WMS\_LOCATION:  This variable must be set when the Glite WMS installation is not located in the default paths: either /opt/glite or /usr/local

GLITE\_LOCATION: This variable must be set when the Glite installation is not located in the default paths: either /opt/glite or /usr/local


GLOBUS\_LOCATION: This variable must be set when the Globus installation is not located in the default path /opt/globus.
It is taken into account only by submission and get-output commands

GLOBUS\_TCP\_PORT\_RANGE="<val min> <val max>" This variable must be set to define a range of ports to be used for inbound connections in the interactivity context.
It is taken into account only by submission of interactive jobs and attach commands

X509\_CERT\_DIR: This variable may be set to override the default location of the trusted certificates directory, which is normally /etc/grid-security/certificates.

X509\_USER\_PROXY: This variable may be set to override the default location of the user proxy credentials, which is normally /tmp/x509up\_u<uid>.

\textbf{FILES}
\smallskip


One of the following paths must exist (seeked with the specified order):
- \$GLITE\_WMS\_LOCATION/etc/
- \$GLITE\_LOCATION/etc/
- /opt/glite/etc/
- /usr/local/etc/
- /etc/

and contain the following UI configuration files:
glite\_wmsui\_cmd\_var.conf, glite\_wmsui\_cmd\_err.conf, glite\_wmsui\_cmd\_help.conf, <voName>/glite\_wmsui.conf

- glite\_wmsui\_cmd\_var.conf will contain custom configuration default values
A different configuration file may be specified either by using the --config option or by setting the GLITE\_WMSUI\_CONFIG\_VAR environment variable
here follows a possible example:
[
RetryCount = 3 ;
ErrorStorage= "/tmp" ;
OutputStorage="/tmp";
ListenerStorage = "/tmp" ;
LoggingTimeout = 30 ;
LoggingSyncTimeout = 30 ;
NSLoggerLevel = 0;
DefaultStatusLevel = 1 ;
DefaultLogInfoLevel = 1;
]

- glite\_wmsui\_cmd\_err.conf will contain UI exception mapping between error codes and error messages (no relocation possible)

- glite\_wmsui\_cmd\_help.conf will contain UI long-help information (no relocation possible)

- <voName>/glite\_wmsui.conf  will contain User VO-specific attributes.
A different configuration file may be specified either by using the --config-vo option or by setting the GLITE\_WMSUI\_CONFIG\_VO environment variable
here follows a possible example:
[
LBAddresses = { "tigerman.cnaf.infn.it:9000" };
VirtualOrganisation = "egee";
NSAddresses = { "tigerman.cnaf.infn.it:7772" }
]

Besides those files, a valid proxy must be found inside the following path:
/tmp/x509up\_u<uid> ( use the X509\_USER\_PROXY environment variable to override the default location JDL file)
